		<h1>New way of traveling outside the Earth discovered.</h1>
		<h2>The researchers say it will reduce travel time in half.</h2>
		
		<hr>
       
		<p>Recent studies at <acronym title="Agencia Nacional de la AeronÃ¡utica y del Espacio">NASA</acronym>facilities have revealed the existence of a new chemical compound that can be used as a rocket fuel with a yield exceeding 97%.</p>
		<p><def>Tetracarbonate dioxodestrin</def>, here in after TCDOD, is a compound obtained mainly from the synthesis of various elements of eucalyptus. After 12 years of research, it has finally been able to synthesize it with sufficient purity to achieve a stable fuel.</p>
        
        <br>
        
		<h3>Day to day applications</h3>
        
		<p>At the moment, the fuel requires special deposits to be stored, due to its high storage pressure. However,a possible adaptation to the usual means of transport, starting with the plane,<em>is not ruled out.</em> is not ruled out.</p>
		        
		<p> <abbr title="profesor">Prof.</abbr> Marshall, TCDOD chief investigator, says that it is the <strong>fuel of the future</strong> given its low cost and high performance, but above all because it is a renewable fuel and hardly generates waste.</p>
		        
		<p>Hopefully the investigations will end soon, oil and natural gas are over!</p>
